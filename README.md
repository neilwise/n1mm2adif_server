# n1mm2adif_server
 UDP QSO Logger for N1MM Logger+ â€” Summary

This Python script acts as a lightweight UDP server designed to integrate with N1MM Logger+. It listens for XML-based <contactinfo> packets sent over UDP, typically when a QSO is logged.
ðŸ”§ What It Does:

    Listens on UDP port 12060 for incoming <contactinfo> XML packets.

    Parses and extracts key QSO details from each packet (e.g., callsign, frequency, mode, signal reports, timestamp).

    Converts and formats the data into a structured tag-based text format.

    Appends each QSO as a single line to a log file at:

    C:\Users\neil\Documents\N1MM Logger+\ExportFiles\auto_adi

    Automatically starts with N1MM Logger+ via an AutoHotKey launch script.

ðŸ›  Notes:

    Frequency is interpreted from txfreq, assuming units of 10 Hz.

    Band is inferred from frequency using standard amateur radio band ranges.

    The script runs continuously and logs each valid <contactinfo> packet in real time.
